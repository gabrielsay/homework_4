When the sum function is given an argument that is a string, it returns the string appended to 0. When the sum function is given an argument that is a number, it returns 0. This is worrisome, because if one uses this function in later blocks of code without checking the argument, then the code will run without giving any sort of error message, and the result of the entire program will be incorrect.The function should be rewritten to check for a nonarray argument to include some sort of error message and terminate the operations so the user knows that the function does not work on a nonarray.
